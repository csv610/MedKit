   * Is itching generalizeHere’s a **comprehensive list of questions and tests** that doctors typically perform during a **physical examination of the skin, hair, and nails**. I’ve structured it systematically with **objectives and medical rationale**, indicating **age- or gender-specific considerations** where relevant.

### **B. Physical Tests/Examination**

1. **Inspection**

   * Observe **color, moisture, texture, turgor, and lesions** over all body areas.
   * Check **sun-exposed vs. covered areas**.
   * **Objective:** Detect systemic disease (cyanosis, jaundice, anemia, etc.) and dermatological conditions.

2. **Palpation**

   * Assess **temperature, texture, moisture, and turgor**.
   * Check for **induration, tenderness, or subcutaneous nodules**.
   * **Objective:** Identify inflammatory, infectious, or systemic conditions.

3. **Mobility & Turgor Test**

   * Gently pinch the skin on the forearm or sternum.
   * **Objective:** Evaluate hydration status and elasticity.

4. **Special Tests**

   * **Diascopy:** Press glass slide on lesions to differentiate vascular vs. non-vascular lesions.
   * **Woods lamp examination:** For fungal infections, pigmentation disorders.
   * **Objective:** Assist in accurate dermatological diagnosis.
