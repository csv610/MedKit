**

### **A. Dietary Intake**

* What is your typical daily diet? (meals, snacks, beverages)
* How many meals do you consume per day?
* Do you follow any special diet (vegetarian, vegan, restricted, ketogenic)?
* Do you consume sufficient fruits, vegetables, dairy, and protein?
* Have there been any recent changes in appetite or food intake?
* Are there any food allergies or intolerances?
* Do you take vitamin or mineral supplements?

### **B. Growth and Development (Pediatric)**

* At what age did your child start walking and talking?
* Has there been any sudden change in height or weight?
* Are there concerns about delayed puberty or abnormal growth?
* Family history of short or tall stature?

### **C. Weight Changes (Adult)**

* Have you experienced unexpAbsolutely. Below is a **comprehensive, guideline-based list of questions, assessments, and tests** typically performed during the **“Nutrition, Growth, and Measurement”** physical examination in clinical practice. This is structured for **pediatric and adult evaluation**, focusing on nutritional status, growth patterns, anthropometry, and biochemical indicators.

---

# **Nutrition, Growth, and Measurement Physical Examination**

## **I. General Objectives**

* Assess overall nutritional status and growth trends.
* Identify malnutrition, overnutrition, or growth abnormalities.
* Monitor anthropometric measures to track development over time.
* Detect risk factors for chronic disease related to nutrition.

---

## **II. History and Subjective Questionslained weight loss or gain recently?
* Any changes in body fat distribution?
* Are there changes in muscle mass or strength?

---

## **III. Physical Examination Components**

### **1. Anthropometric Measurements**

**Objective:** Quantify growth and nutritional status.
**Tests / Measurements:**

* **Height / Length:** Use stadiometer for standing height; infantometer for infants.
* **Weight:** Use calibrated scale.
* **Body Mass Index (BMI):** Weight (kg) / Height (m²).
* **Head Circumference (infants):** Measure occipitofrontal circumference.
* **Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC):** Detect malnutrition in children.
* **Waist Circumference & Waist-Hip Ratio:** Assess central obesity.
* **Skinfold Thickness:** Triceps, subscapular, biceps (estimate fat stores).
* **Growth Percentiles / Z-scores:** Compare against WHO or CDC charts.

**Medical Significance:**

* Low BMI → undernutrition, chronic illness.
* High BMI → overweight, obesity, metabolic syndrome.
* MUAC <11.5 cm → severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children.

---

### **2. Physical Signs of Nutritional Deficiency**

**Objective:** Detect micronutrient deficiencies and protein-energy malnutrition.
**Examination Sites & Signs:**

* **Hair:** Sparse, brittle, depigmented → protein or zinc deficiency.
* **Skin:** Dry, scaly, hyperpigmented, dermatitis → vitamin A, essential fatty acids, or niacin deficiency.
* **Nails:** Spoon-shaped (koilonychia) → iron deficiency; brittle nails → protein deficiency.
* **Eyes:** Bitot’s spots → vitamin A deficiency; pale conjunctiva → iron deficiency.
* **Mouth / Tongue:** Glossitis → iron, vitamin B12, folate deficiency; cheilitis → riboflavin deficiency.
* **Teeth:** Delayed eruption, enamel hypoplasia → malnutrition.
* **Muscle Wasting:** Visible loss of muscle mass → chronic undernutrition.
* **Subcutaneous Fat Loss:** Prominent bones → protein-energy malnutrition.

---

### **3. Functional Assessment**

**Objective:** Assess the impact of nutrition on strength and daily function.
**Tests:**

* Handgrip strength using dynamometer (adults / adolescents).
* Developmental milestones in children (motor, language, social).
* Physical endurance (walking, stair climbing, physical activity tolerance).

**Medical Significance:**

* Weak grip → protein-calorie malnutrition, sarcopenia.
* Developmental delay → chronic malnutrition or micronutrient deficiency.

---

### **4. Growth Pattern Analysis**

**Objective:** Track longitudinal growth and detect deviations from expected trends.
**Measurements & Analysis:**

* Plot height, weight, BMI, and head circumference on growth charts.
* Calculate **weight-for-age, height-for-age, BMI-for-age** percentiles in children.
* Compare against **parental heights** to assess genetic potential.
* Detect **stunting (low height-for-age)**, **wasting (low weight-for-height)**, **obesity (high BMI-for-age)**.

**Medical Significance:**

* Stunting → chronic malnutrition or systemic disease.
* Wasting → acute malnutrition.
* Obesity → risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular disease.

---

### **5. Biochemical and Laboratory Assessment (Optional / Follow-Up)**

**Objective:** Confirm clinical suspicion of nutritional deficiencies.
**Common Tests:**

* Hemoglobin, hematocrit → anemia (iron, B12, folate).
* Serum albumin and prealbumin → protein status.
* Electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, magnesium → mineral status.
* Vitamins: Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Vitamin A, Folate.
* Lipid profile → obesity/metabolic risk.

**Medical Significance:**

* Confirms deficiencies not apparent on physical exam.
* Guides supplementation and dietary interventions.

---

### **6. Screening Questionnaires / Risk Assessments**

* **Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST)** – adults.
* **Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA)** – elderly.
* **Dietary Diversity Score** – children.
* **24-Hour Recall / Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)** – qualitative assessment.

---

### **7. Professional Observations**

* Record **symmetry of growth**, muscle/fat distribution, and **any abnormalities**.
* Note **changes compared with prior visits** (longitudinal tracking).
* Record **functional impact** (endurance, strength, daily activities).
