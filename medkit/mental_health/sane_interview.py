"""sane_interview - Trauma-informed interview system for Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners.

This module provides a comprehensive, trauma-informed chatbot system for conducting
Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) interviews. It guides interviewers through
structured sections covering consent, medical history, incident details, physical
injuries, forensic evidence, treatment options, psychological assessment, and
legal/follow-up planning.

The system prioritizes survivor dignity, safety, and agency while ensuring thorough
documentation needed for medical care, forensic evidence collection, and potential
legal proceedings. All questions allow patients to decline answering, maintaining
their autonomy and control throughout the interview.

QUICK START:
    from sane_interview import SANEInterviewChatbot

    # Initialize and run interview
    chatbot = SANEInterviewChatbot()
    interview = chatbot.conduct_interview()

    if interview:
        # Save interview record to file
        chatbot.save_interview("interview_record.json")
        print("Interview completed and saved")
    else:
        print("Interview could not proceed without consent")

COMMON USES:
    1. Conducting forensic exams in acute sexual assault cases
    2. Documenting survivor account and physical evidence
    3. Collecting information for potential criminal investigation
    4. Assessing immediate medical and psychological needs
    5. Providing referrals for ongoing support and legal resources
    6. Creating clinical documentation for victim advocacy

KEY FEATURES:
    - Trauma-Informed Approach: All questions allow declining to answer, with
      emphasis on survivor control, safety, and dignity throughout
    - Structured Sections: 10 sections covering consent, medical/incident history,
      sexual contact details, injury assessment, forensic evidence, treatment
      discussion, psychological assessment, legal considerations, and closure
    - Forensic Focus: Specific questions about evidence preservation, post-assault
      activities, and items left behind relevant to DNA/trace evidence
    - Comprehensive Assessment: Injury documentation, pain assessment, sexual
      contact type documentation, and physical/emotional response evaluation

      housing/transportation assistance assessment
    - JSON Documentation: Complete interview data saved in structured format for
      medical record integration and legal proceedings
    - Sensitive Language: Respectful, non-judgmental questioning with appropriate
      terminology and emotional support messaging
