"""llm_sane_interview - AI-Assisted SANE Interview System with LLM Question Suggestions.

Extends the base SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) interview system with
intelligent, context-aware question suggestions powered by LLMs. Maintains a
strict "AI suggests, nurse decides" principle where all AI recommendations are
reviewed and approved by the nurse before use. Designed for sensitive trauma
assessment with privacy-first architecture.

Provides rule-based and LLM-powered question suggestions that consider clinical
relevance, forensic evidence implications, and patient safety. Tracks suggestion
acceptance rates and generates interview statistics. Supports both local model
execution and external API usage with anonymization warnings.

QUICK START:
    Run the LLM-assisted SANE interview:

        python llm_sane_interview.py

    Then select whether to enable AI assistance when prompted. The system will:
    1. Conduct the standard SANE interview protocol
    2. Offer AI-suggested follow-up questions based on patient responses
    3. Allow you to accept, reject, or create custom questions
    4. Generate a complete interview record

    Use programmatically:

        from llm_sane_interview import LLMAssistedSANEChatbot

        chatbot = LLMAssistedSANEChatbot(use_llm_assist=True, local_model=True)
        interview = chatbot.conduct_interview()
        chatbot.save_interview("interview_record.json")

COMMON USES:
    - Conducting comprehensive SANE assessments with AI support
    - Generating contextual follow-up questions for complex cases
    - Training healthcare providers on SANE protocols
    - Ensuring thorough documentation of medical and forensic findings
    - Identifying critical safety concerns (suicidal ideation, ongoing threat)
    - Collecting forensic evidence with systematic questioning

KEY FEATURES:
    - AI-powered question suggestions with priority levels (critical/high/medium/low)
    - Rule-based suggestion engine for high-sensitivity scenarios
    - Nurse-controlled approval workflow for all suggestions
    - Safety detection (suicidal ideation, trafficking indicators)
    - Forensic evidence optimization (timeline, contamination awareness)
    - Medical documentation (injuries, symptoms, substance use)
    - Custom follow-up question support
    - Privacy-first architecture with local model option
    - Complete interview statistics tracking
    - JSON export for medical records and law enforcement coordination
