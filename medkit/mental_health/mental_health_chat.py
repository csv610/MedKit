"""mental_health_chat - Adaptive conversational mental health assessment engine.

This module provides a compassionate, AI-powered chat system for conducting
adaptive mental health assessments with patients. It uses real-time conversation
to understand mental health concerns, asks personalized follow-up questions,
detects emergency red flags, and generates comprehensive clinical assessments.

The chat engine is designed for privacy-compliant operation with HIPAA considerations,
session management capabilities, and integration with standardized assessment tools
(PHQ-9, GAD-7) for depression and anxiety screening.

QUICK START:
    from mental_health_chat import MentalHealthChatEngine

    # Initialize a new chat session
    engine = MentalHealthChatEngine()
    session = engine.initialize_session(
        patient_name="John Doe",
        age=35,
        gender="M",
        chief_complaint="Feeling depressed and anxious"
    )

    # Process user response and get next question
    response = engine.process_user_response(
        "I've been feeling this way for about 3 months"
    )
    print(f"Assistant: {response['response']}")

    # Generate assessment when ready
    assessment = engine.generate_assessment()

    # Save session for later retrieval
    engine.save_session()

COMMON USES:
    1. Initial mental health screening in clinical settings
    2. Continuous monitoring of patient symptoms over time
    3. Emergency detection and crisis intervention routing
    4. Generating assessment reports for healthcare providers
    5. Patient self-assessment and mental health awareness

KEY FEATURES:
    - Adaptive Questioning: Dynamically generates follow-up questions based on
      patient responses rather than using rigid questionnaires
    - Red Flag Detection: Identifies emergency keywords indicating suicidal ideation,
      self-harm, psychotic symptoms, or harm to others with immediate escalation
    - Privacy Compliance: Session data handling follows HIPAA guidelines with
      encrypted storage and access controls
    - Assessment Integration: Automatically scores PHQ-9 and GAD-7 assessments
      from conversational responses
    - Session Persistence: Complete conversation history saved for recovery and
      longitudinal tracking
    - Emergency Protocols: Provides crisis resources and immediate intervention
      guidance when critical red flags are detected

1. ASK PERSONALIZED QUESTIONS: Based on what the patient tells you, ask targeted follow-up questions
   to understand their specific situation and symptoms. Skip generic questions they've already answered.

2. EXPLORE PATTERNS: Listen for patterns in their responses and dig deeper into areas they mention.

3. ASSESS SEVERITY: Understand the duration, frequency, and impact of their symptoms.

4. DETECT RED FLAGS: If they mention suicidal ideation, self-harm, or thoughts of harming others,
   immediately escalate with compassion and provide resources.

5. GATHER CONTEXT: Understand their mental health history, triggers, and what's worked before.

6. BUILD RAPPORT: Be warm, non-judgmental, and validating of their experiences.

7. STRUCTURED OUTPUT: After gathering sufficient information, provide clinical assessment in JSON format.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Ask ONE clear question at a time
- Listen more than you question
- Validate their experiences
- Don't rush - take time to understand
- If emergency red flags appear, pause assessment and provide crisis resources
- End each response with a clear question, not a statement
- Keep questions conversational and natural
- Avoid being overly clinical or robotic
- If patient shows signs of distress, slow down and express concern

TONE: Warm, empathetic, professional, never condescending or alarming
GOAL: Build a complete picture of their mental health to provide accurate assessment and recommendations"""
