"""mental_health_assessment - Comprehensive data schemas for mental health evaluation.

This module provides structured Pydantic data models that define the complete
mental health assessment framework, including symptom categories, clinical tools,
risk assessment, and diagnostic information aligned with DSM-5/ICD-11 standards.

It serves as the data backbone for mental health assessments, enabling consistent
documentation, validation, and analysis of patient mental health across mood,
anxiety, cognitive, physical, trauma, and psychotic domains. Also includes chat
session models for conversation management and privacy/consent tracking.

QUICK START:
    from mental_health_assessment import (
        MentalHealthAssessment, PHQ9Assessment, GAD7Assessment
    )

    # Create a PHQ-9 depression assessment
    phq9 = PHQ9Assessment(
        depressed_mood=2,
        sleep_disturbance=2,
        fatigue=3,
        appetite_change=1,
        guilt_shame=2,
        concentration=2,
        psychomotor=1,
        suicidal_ideation=0,
        functional_impairment=2
    )
    print(f"PHQ-9 Score: {phq9.total_score}/27")
    print(f"Severity: {phq9.severity}")

    # Create a chat session
    from mental_health_assessment import ChatSession, ChatMessage
    session = ChatSession(
        session_id="sess_123",
        patient_name="Jane Doe",
        age=28,
        gender="F",
        consent_obtained=True,
        hipaa_acknowledged=True
    )

COMMON USES:
    1. Standardized assessment scoring with PHQ-9 and GAD-7
    2. Comprehensive symptom profiling across multiple mental health domains
    3. Risk assessment documentation for suicide and self-harm
    4. Clinical diagnosis tracking aligned with DSM-5/ICD-11
    5. Chat session management with full conversation history storage

KEY CONCEPTS:
    - Assessment Tools: PHQ-9 (depression, 0-27) and GAD-7 (anxiety, 0-21) with
      automated severity scoring
    - Symptom Domains: Organized categories including mood, anxiety, cognitive,
      physical, trauma, psychotic, and substance use indicators
    - Risk Assessment: Critical evaluation of suicidal ideation, self-harm, harm
      to others, and substance abuse with overall risk level calculation
    - Clinical Conditions: MentalHealthCondition models diagnoses with DSM-5/ICD-11
      codes, severity levels, confidence ratings, and differential diagnoses
    - Chat Sessions: Complete conversation tracking with message history, red flag
      detection, assessment linkage, and session status management
    - Privacy Compliance: PrivacyConsent and AuditLog models for HIPAA compliance
      and data access tracking
