Memory Testing Protocol:
  1. IMMEDIATE RECALL: Ask patient to repeat sentences and number sequences
     - Forward digits: 3-8+ digit sequences
     - Backward digits: 2-6+ digit sequences
     - Sentence repetition

  2. RECENT MEMORY (Present objects/words to remember):
     - Standard items: carpet, iris, bench, fortune
     - Or objects: pen, watch, coin, key
     - Recall at: immediate, 5 minutes, 10 minutes

  3. REMOTE MEMORY: Ask about verifiable past events
     - Mother's maiden name
     - High school name and location
     - Parents' occupations
     - Childhood address(es)
     - Significant family events
     - Common knowledge (current date, president, historical events)

  4. WORKING MEMORY: Manipulation tasks
     - Recite digits backward
     - Spell words backward
     - Count backward from 20
