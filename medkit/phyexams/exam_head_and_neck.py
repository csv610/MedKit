Head and Neck Assessment Protocol:
  1. SCALP ASSESSMENT: Palpate for symmetry, smooth bones, lesions, parasites
     - Document any indentations, depressions, scabs, tenderness
     - Check for scalp condition (normal/abnormal)

  2. HAIR ASSESSMENT: Evaluate texture, color, thickness, and distribution
     - Assess for splitting/cracking, breakage, hair loss patterns
     - Note male/female pattern baldness or alopecia

  3. FACIAL FEATURES: Inspect head position, symmetry, and facial appearance
     - Note any edema, coarsening, prominent eyes, hirsutism
     - Evaluate facial expression and skin pigmentation

  4. TEMPORAL ARTERIES: Palpate for course, thickening, hardness, tenderness
     - Auscultate for bruits over skull, eyes, and temporal regions
     - Document any abnormalities concerning for temporal arteritis

  5. SALIVARY GLANDS: Inspect and palpate for symmetry, enlargement, tenderness
     - Express salivary ducts to assess material quality
     - Note any discrete nodules or asymmetry

  6. NECK INSPECTION: Assess position, symmetry, and muscle development
     - Note JVD, carotid prominence, webbing, short neck, edema
     - Check for torticollis or other abnormalities

  7. TRACHEA: Inspect position (midline/deviated) and movement with swallowing
     - Assess for masses, deviation, or tracheal tug
     - Document any abnormalities

  8. THYROID: Palpate for size, symmetry, consistency, mobility, nodules
     - Auscultate for bruits if enlarged
     - Document nodule characteristics and lower border position

  9. LYMPH NODES: Palpate neck nodes for size, consistency, mobility, tenderness
     - Note any matting, fixation, warmth, or concerning characteristics
     - Assess regional distribution and characteristics
