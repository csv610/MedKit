Lymphatic System Assessment Protocol:
  1. LYMPH NODE ASSESSMENT: Palpate nodes in neck, armpits, groin, elbows
     - Document size, location, consistency, mobility, tenderness
     - Assess for generalized vs localized lymphadenopathy

  2. EDEMA ASSESSMENT: Check for swelling in arms, legs, face
     - Determine if pitting or non-pitting
     - Measure circumferences for asymmetry
     - Assess skin changes (fibrosis, color changes)

  3. DRAINAGE ASSESSMENT: Evaluate lymphatic flow and obstruction
     - Check for asymmetry suggesting obstruction
     - Assess venous insufficiency
     - Look for collateral circulation

  4. SYSTEMIC ASSESSMENT: Evaluate for associated symptoms
     - Fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss
     - Recurrent infections in affected areas
     - Pain and functional limitations

  5. HISTORY: Cancer treatment, surgery, trauma affecting lymphatic system
     - Node removal, radiation, chemotherapy
     - Previous surgeries in affected areas
     - Current medications affecting function
