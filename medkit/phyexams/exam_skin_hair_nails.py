Skin, Hair, and Nails Examination Protocol:

  EQUIPMENT NEEDED:
  - Centimeter ruler (flexible, clear)
  - Flashlight with transilluminator
  - Wood's lamp (for fluorescing lesions)
  - Optional: Handheld magnifying lens

  1. GENERAL SKIN INSPECTION:
     - Overall color uniformity and variations
     - Sun-exposed vs. non-exposed areas
     - Generalized color changes (jaundice, cyanosis, pallor)
     - All body areas including intertriginous surfaces
     - Overall cleanliness and hygiene

  2. SKIN COLOR AND PIGMENTATION:
     - Brown discoloration (melanin, freckles, age spots)
     - White areas (vitiligo, depigmentation)
     - Red areas (erythema, flush, vascular changes)
     - Yellow coloration (jaundice, carotenemia)
     - Blue discoloration (cyanosis)
     - Chloasma (melasma - facial hyperpigmentation)
     - Pigmented nevi and birthmarks

  3. SKIN THICKNESS AND TEXTURE:
     - General skin thickness and calluses
     - Areas of thickening from friction/rubbing
     - Atrophy, hyperkeratosis, corns
     - Overall texture (smooth, rough, scaly)
     - Bilateral symmetry

  4. SKIN PALPATION:
     - Moisture: Minimal perspiration (normal in axillae, palms, scalp)
     - Temperature: Cool to warm, bilateral symmetry
     - Texture: Smooth, soft, even (roughness from environment/clothing)
     - Turgor/Mobility: Skin should return immediately after pinching (dehydration if slow)
     - Edema: Pitting or non-pitting edema assessment

  5. SKIN LESIONS (if present):
     - Size: Measure with ruler in mm or cm
     - Shape: Round, oval, irregular, linear
     - Color: Tan, brown, black, red, pink, etc. (use Wood's lamp)
     - Blanching: Does it blanch with pressure?
     - Texture: Smooth, rough, scaly, crusted
     - Elevation/Depression: Flat (macule) vs. raised (papule, plaque, nodule)
     - Exudate: Color, odor, amount, consistency
     - Configuration: Solitary, grouped, linear, annular, diffuse
     - Location/Distribution: Body area, unilateral/bilateral, symmetric/asymmetric
     - Secondary changes: Excoriation, erosion, scarring

  6. PRIMARY LESION TYPES:
     - Macule (<1cm flat), Patch (>1cm flat)
     - Papule (<1cm elevated), Plaque (>1cm elevated)
     - Nodule (1-2cm in dermis), Tumor (>2cm)
     - Vesicle (<1cm fluid), Bulla (>1cm fluid)
     - Pustule (fluid with pus), Cyst (encapsulated)
     - Wheal (edema, transient)
     - Telangiectasia (fine capillary lines)

  7. HAIR EXAMINATION:
     - Color: Light blond to black, graying pattern
     - Distribution: Scalp, face, body areas, pubic
     - Hair loss: None, androgenetic (vertex), female pattern (diffuse), patchy
     - Hirsutism: Excessive in women (face, chest, abdomen)
     - Texture: Coarse/fine, curly/straight, shiny/dull
     - Condition: Dry, brittle, oily, resilient
     - Scalp condition: Clean, oily, flaking, dermatitis
     - Inflammation/scarring: Folliculitis, trichotillomania

  8. NAIL EXAMINATION:
     - Color: Pink with variations, white spots (normal), yellow/green (abnormal)
     - Shape: Smooth, flat, convex, clubbed (>160° base angle)
     - Length/Configuration: Smooth edges, jagged, broken, bitten
     - Ridging: Longitudinal (normal), transverse/Beau's lines, pitting
     - Texture/Firmness: Hard, smooth, uniform thickness
     - Nail Bed: Firmly attached, not separated/boggy
     - Base Angle: Normal 160°, clubbing >180°
     - Proximal/Lateral Folds: Erythema, swelling, pus, paronychia
     - Subungual: Debris, blood, hyphae (fungal)

  9. MUCOUS MEMBRANES:
     - Lips: Color, moisture, cracks, lesions
     - Buccal mucosa: Color, pigmentation
     - Tongue: Color, texture, fissures, thrush
     - Gums: Color, bleeding, recession, swelling
     - Teeth: Condition, cavities, missing, dentures
     - Palate: Color, lesions, cleft
     - Pharynx: Color, exudate, tonsillar enlargement
     - Sclerae: Icterus (jaundice) present?

  10. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS ASSESSMENT:
      - Eczematous dermatitis: Pruritic, vesicular, scaling lesions
      - Folliculitis: Pustules over hair follicles
      - Tinea: Pruritic, scaling, ring-like lesions
      - Basal cell carcinoma: Pearly nodule, rolled border, central indentation
      - Squamous cell carcinoma: Scaly growth, ulceration, rapid growth
      - Malignant melanoma: Asymmetry, irregular border, color variation, >6mm
      - Other conditions: Psoriasis, lichen planus, rosacea, urticaria

  EXPECTED FINDINGS:
  - Variations in skin color between sun-exposed/non-exposed areas
  - Normal pigmented nevi, freckles
  - Smooth skin texture, good turgor
  - Minimal perspiration in appropriate areas
  - Normal hair distribution for age/sex/ethnicity
  - Normal nail color, shape, growth
  - Clean, pink mucous membranes

  UNEXPECTED FINDINGS:
  - Generalized color changes (jaundice, cyanosis)
  - Dysplastic/precancerous nevi
  - Poor skin turgor (dehydration)
  - Excessive hair loss, hirsutism
  - Clubbing, separation, discolored nails
  - Oral lesions, poor dentition
  - Concerning lesions suggesting malignancy
