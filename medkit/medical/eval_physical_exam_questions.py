"""eval_physical_exam_questions - Evaluate quality of generated physical exam questions.

This module assesses the quality and compliance of medical exam questions using LLM-powered
evaluation. It analyzes question clarity, clinical relevance, medical standards compliance,
cultural sensitivity, and trauma-informed design. Generates detailed evaluation reports with
scored criteria, section-specific feedback, strengths, improvement areas, and recommendations.

QUICK START:
    Evaluate exam questions from a JSON file:

    >>> from eval_physical_exam_questions import evaluate_exam_questions
    >>> evaluation = evaluate_exam_questions("exam_questions.json")
    >>> print(f"Overall Score: {evaluation.overall_quality_score}/100")

    Or use the CLI:

    $ python eval_physical_exam_questions.py -i exam_questions.json
    $ python eval_physical_exam_questions.py -i exam_questions.json -o report.txt -j results.json

COMMON USES:
    1. Question quality assurance - validating exam question sets before deployment
    2. Curriculum development - ensuring questions meet medical education standards
    3. Compliance verification - checking cultural sensitivity and trauma-informed design
    4. Performance improvement - identifying specific areas needing revision
    5. Standards compliance - confirming adherence to medical examination guidelines

KEY FEATURES AND COVERAGE AREAS:
    - Medical Standards Compliance: validates against current medical guidelines
    - Question Sufficiency: checks adequate coverage across exam sections
    - Relevancy Scoring: measures alignment with specific exam types
    - Clinical Accuracy: verifies evidence-based medical information
    - Clarity Assessment: evaluates patient comprehensibility
    - Cultural Sensitivity: ensures respectful language and inclusive design
    - Trauma-Informed Evaluation: assesses sensitivity to patient safety and autonomy
    - Detailed Section Evaluations: feedback for each exam section
    - Pass/Fail Verdict: overall quality determination
