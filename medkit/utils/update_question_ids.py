"""update_question_ids - Batch update JSON question files to standardize field names.

This module processes JSON exam question files and standardizes field names for consistency.
It replaces deprecated field names (question_number, answer_method, follow_up_prompts) with
current standard names (id, responder, followup_questions). Processes entire outputs directory
in batch, generating default follow-up questions if none exist, enabling seamless schema
migration and data consistency across question files.

QUICK START:
    Update all question JSON files in the outputs directory:

    $ python update_question_ids.py

    The script will:
    - Replace question_number with id
    - Replace answer_method with responder
    - Replace/update follow_up_prompts with followup_questions
    - Generate default questions if none provided
    - Report count of updated files

    Or use programmatically:

    >>> from update_question_ids import update_json_file
    >>> updated = update_json_file("exam_file.json")
    >>> print(f"Updated: {updated}")

COMMON USES:
    1. Schema migration - updating to new question field names
    2. Batch updates - processing multiple exam files consistently
    3. Data standardization - ensuring uniform question structure
    4. Question generation - populating missing follow-up questions
    5. File processing - automated bulk field renaming

KEY FEATURES AND COVERAGE AREAS:
    - Field Renaming: question_number → id, answer_method → responder
    - Follow-up Questions: manages follow_up_prompts/followup_questions field
    - Default Generation: creates 5 generic follow-up questions if missing
    - Batch Processing: updates all JSON files in outputs directory
    - Structure Detection: identifies and processes question_data format
    - Error Handling: catches JSON and data structure errors gracefully
    - Flexible Updates: preserves existing data while adding defaults
    - Status Reporting: logs all processed files and update count
